   text:
    <p>The Solidity Summit is a free interactive forum for people involved and interested in the Solidity language and the ecosystem around it. 
    It features discussions & talks on Solidity, Yul, language design and tooling.
    The event wants to promote useful discussions that result in language improvement proposals, leading to actual implementations. 
    Furthermore, we aim to foster communication between teams working on similar topics and identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem for Ethereum. <br><br>
    You can find the agenda of the 2020 online edition <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ylkaTYKx9TbAifCgyH2jN9SKJKrYfzab9zzTZgSL44g/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.  
 - title: WHO CAN JOIN?
   text:
    <p>Do you have a change proposal for the Solidity language? Are you using a language feature in a novel way that might benefit others?
    Do you want to build a debugger but are missing information from the compiler?
    Are you working with Solidity on a day-to-day basis and just want to hang out with similar-minded people?
    Then this event is for you!</p>
