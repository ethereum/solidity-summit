title: Solidity Summit
date: 29/30 april<br>Berlin
subtitle: Two-day, friendly-sized single-track event with talks and workshops
description: |
   The Solidity team is organizing a Solidity summit in Berlin to gather people involved and interested in the language, 
   the ecosystem, and tooling around it. We would like to have useful discussions that will hopefully result in actual proposals that are later implemented.
   In particular, this event should help increase the amount of communication between teams working on similar 
   topics or on topics that build on top of each other and identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem for Ethereum.

   Do you have a proposal for a change to the Solidity language? Are you using a language feature in a certain way that others are not aware about?
   Do you want to build a debugger but are missing information from the compiler?
   Are you working with Solidity on a day-to-day basis and just want to hang out with similar-minded people?
   Then this event is for you!

   If you want to participate - be it as a visitor or by giving a talk - please fill out the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SMJa_ezfNLGNzBB4YLdQXn5Jk-b4RsUSuJdj5KbbYhU).
   Please submit talk applications by the end of February!

   Ticket prices are still to be determined, but proceeds from tickets will be used to cover costs of venue and production costs.
   Limited number of scholarships for students and discounted tickets will be available as well, please get in touch with us by email!
