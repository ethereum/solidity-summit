description: |
   The Solidity team is organizing a Solidity summit in Berlin to gather people involved and interested in the language, 
   the ecosystem, and tooling around it. We would like to have useful discussions that will hopefully result in actual proposals that are later implemented. In particular, this event should help increase the amount of communication between teams working on similar 
   topics or on topics that build on top of each other and identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem for Ethereum.
